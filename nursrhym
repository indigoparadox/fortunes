The fair maid who, the first of May,
Goes to the fields at break of day,
And washes in dew from the hawthorn-tree,
Will ever after handsome be.

Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
Silver bells and cockle-shells,
And pretty maids all of a row.

High diddle doubt, my candle
My little maid is not at home;
Saddle my hog and bridle my dog,
And fetch my little maid home.

My maid Mary she minds the dairy
While I go a-hoeing and mowing each morn;
Gaily run the reel and the little spinning wheel.
While I am singing and mowing my corn.

As I walked by myself,
And talked to myself,
Myself said unto me:
“Look to thyself,
Take care of thyself,
For nobody cares for thee.”
