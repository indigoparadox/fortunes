You've been trolled! You've been trolled!
You have probably been told
Don't reply, to this guy
He is just getting a rise
Out you! Yes it's true!
You respond and thats his cue
To start trouble on the double
While he strokes his manly stubble
You've been trolled! You've been trolled!
You should probably just fold
When the only winning move is not to pla~ay
And yet you keep on trying
Mindlessly replying
You've been trolled! You've been trolled!
HAVE A NICE DAY!

I am a C programmer and I am okay,
I play with indices and data structs all day,
And when it all works I shout hoo-ray!
I am a C programmer and I am okay.

I'M GONNA BE THE GOD OF EARTH
LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS
TO KILL THEM IS MY REAL MEANS
TO JUDGE THEM IS MY CAUSE

I WILL MURDER ACROSS THE LAND
KILLING FAR AND WIDE
EACH CRIMINAL TO EXECUTE
THEY WILL NEVER HIDE

(DEATH NOTE)
IT'S YOU AND ME
I KNOW IT'S MY DESTINY
(DEATH NOTE)
OH YOUR MY BEST FRIEND
IN A WORLD I MUST CONDEMN

DEATH NOTE 
GOTTA KILL EM ALL
DEATH NOTE

Some~day I want to run away~
To the world of midnight~

Where the darkness fills the air~
Where it's icy cold~

Where~ nobody has a name~
Where~ living is not a game~

There~ I'll hide my broken heart~
Dying to survive~

There~ no one can see me cry~
Tears of my lonely soul~

I'll~ fi~nd peace of mind~
In the dark and cold world of midnight~

Like a million faces, I've recognized them all~
And one by one they've all become a number as they fall! (As they fall~)

In the face of reason, well I can't take no more~
One by one they've all become a black mark on the floor!

You are here alone again,
In your sweet insanity,
All too calm, you hide yourself from reality...

Do you call it solitude?
Do you call it liberty?
When all the world turns away to leave you lonely...

I believe in my future,
Farewell to the shadow.
It was my place to live,
But now I need your hand.
Lead me out with your light,
I have breathed in,
The disgusting air of darkness,
But I never lose out- to the pressure~
Everything's~ just like~
An illusion~ I'll be losing you~
Before long~

I know you were sup~por~ting me~
Sup~por~ting me~
Sup~por~ting me~
I'll be losing you before long~

Without you~
There's nothing for me to do~
Can you feel the sunshine too~?
It's coming through~
It makes me feel brand new~

And today~
It's gonna be a brighter day~

Evil is everywhere,
Good doesn't have a prayer!
Good is commendable,
Evil's dependable!
Evil is viable,
Good's unreliable!
Good may be thankable-
Evil is bankable!

Evil's for me~ you can have good!
'Doesn't suit me~ to be Robin Hood!

Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo,
Aureli pathice et cinaede Furi,
qui me ex versiculis meis putastis,
quod sunt molliculi, parum pudicum.
Nam castum esse decet pium poetam
ipsum, versiculos nihil necessest (necesse est);
qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem,
si sunt molliculi ac parum pudici
et quod pruriat incitare possunt,
non dico pueris, sed his pilosis
qui duros nequeunt movere lumbos.
Vos, quod milia multa basiorum
legistis, male me marem putatis?
Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo.
