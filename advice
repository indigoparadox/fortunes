Misspelling a word or using the wrong word is fine, linguistically, if many
people consistently misspell or misuse the same word in the same way. This is
why language changes and you don't see people addressing each other with "thou"
and the word "nice" doesn't mean "stupid" anymore. But typing up a thought
riddled with odd and varied misspellings and/or inappropriate grammar or
punctuation-- especially in this day and age of every text field having an
optional spell checker attached to it-- is just indicative of laziness, lack of
attention to detail, and general thoughtlessness.
