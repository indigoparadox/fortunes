You can't educate most of them. They don't want to learn. It's unfortunate but 
it's the truth. Laypeople think that "firewall" and "anti virus" is all they 
need to keep them safe from nasty people. I have the unfortunate task of 
dealing with people like that on a daily basis (many ask why I'm so jaded) and 
they don't care what the real experts say. 

If you tell average Joe that he shouldn't do something that he wants to because
it's a bad idea and then Joe's "expert" mate says "nah man you've got firewall 
and AV installed you'll be right" he'll ignore you. He will listen to the 
"expert" mate of theirs that installed Windows once or twice using the restore 
disk that came with their shiny Dull PC and now thinks they know everything 
because the "expert" doesn't get in their way of doing stupid things.

"I wouldn't be surprised if Jesus would recommend that the
parents of these students stop paying the private school fees 
and send their kids to a State school, giving the money to the 
poor instead. This, and His further recommendations concerning 
luxury cars and large houses containing home theatre equipment, 
would probably fall on deaf ears.

I imagine Jesus would then go on, doggedly, to decry 
corporatism in general, including but not limited to record 
companies.

If asked about music copying, Jesus would probably request 
His audience stop bothering Him with trivia, and hold forth 
for a while about alleged Christians who support wars.

Hey /a/, I just thought of a revolutionary new idea for like, economy
and stuff. Anti-money. Money with a negative value. Like, an anti-dime 
is worth -10 cents, an anti-quarter -25, etc. So picture it. Some guys 
come to your door asking you to pay a debt, but you don't have any money? 
They'd be like "oh, it's okay, we'll just give you these anti-dollars." 
Being given anti-dollars makes you lose money, and giving away anti-dollars 
makes you gain money, so it's the same thing. Put fifty cents in a vending 
machine for a 60c soda? You get a soda and an anti-dime. And anti-money could 
also be used in a war to make the other country run out of money. Just fly 
over them and drop big crates of anti-dollars.

So what do you think, /a/? Bet you wished you'd thought of it first, but nah,
it's MY idea, don't steal it.

Share whatever music or movies you want because they basically broke their deal
with us. That's right, they had a deal with us. We the people allowed creators 
of ideas, inventions, works of art, ect, to have a monopoly on that creation 
for a limited time so that they can make back their initial investment into 
that creation. For allowing them that grace period, they would then allow that 
work to fall into the public domain so everybody could benefit.

They broke their end of the deal by not letting that time period ever run out. 
So basically, deals off and I'll do whatever I god damned want. Until they come
back to the negotiation table it's open season on their ass. Most of

While I was in the Air Force, we were deployed on a hill near the base, and 
listening in on the HF chatter from the various planes coming in.

A British harrier pilot requested permission for a short landing, and was 
declined due to ice on the runway, and told to hold until brake values were
good for landing. So he requested permission for a low-altitude fly-by instead.

30 feet of the ground, thrusters turned downwards, at a speed of about ten 
knots, he literally de-iced the entire length of the runway, before requesting
permission for a short landing again.

threw his suits over the "hangers" and cleared the checkpoint without incident.

I have no idea.

I do know I am probably more terrified of cops than I am of criminals I have
known.

Most criminals don't have the power to ruin my life by mistake. Like, if a
random misidentifies me in a crime, I might go to jail. If a cop does, I
absolutely will. If a random person mistakenly thinks I might have drugs in my
car, they might avoid me. If a cop makes that mistake, they will total my car
and I'll have no recourse.

I avoid cops in the same way an ant avoids a foot, or the same way I don't
touch a hot stove. I don't think either are bad. I don't blame either. I think
being squished or burned is something I don't want to happen.

I also don't think I see any evidence of there being any effort to really
reduce the amount of harms cops can do by accident. So there's a lot I'd do or
go through before calling one.

no one will ever really know you. You and I and every single person on this

Someone brought up the following metaphor to explain Meltdown and spectre:

Imagine you're in middle management and you (Process1) and your fellow 
co worker (Process 2) share an assistant called "CPU".

Due to his contract he isn't allowed to tell you what your co worker is
working on and neither is he allowed to tell your co worker what you are
working on.

Now you just ask him if he could send you the financial reports of your company
and observer how fast he does so. By comparing his "response time" to other
requests you can make a guess about what he pulled from cache (was working on
already) and what he had to get first. You're indirectly asking him what your
co worker is doing via random requests.
%
Have you run into a situation where your trust in the company is truly tested?

For instance, in the context of interpersonal relationships/friendships, I've
noticed that people think they are "good" friends when they potentially aren't.
The first real test of a friendship comes around when they have a serious and
legitimate disagreement or argument about something. Most friendships do not
survive past this stage and most shallow friendships never get to go through
such a test either so the people in the friendship go on thinking they have a
meaningful and strong friendship and this impression is likely an illusion.

What I am trying to say is that until a genuine test comes along, you can't
truly say a friendship is solid or a company is great. Call me cynical but
reality has consistently failed to prove this view wrong.

That is why it is important to calculate the amount of slack in the rope which
is used for hanging. The calculation is based on the body weight of the subject
with drop distance. If there is too less drop then it will result in nasty
asphyxiation, if there is too much drop then it will be a clean decapitation
like that is Saddam Hussein. Drop distance in feet = 1260 to 1100/weight in
pounds; tells you how much drop distance must be there with fully extended rope.

Type of rope is also important. Best rope out there is Hemp rope, or one can
use any other ideally non stretchable rope itself.

In the first book Catelyn refers to "it" as quickening, in the old definition
of the word which means to thicken. And in this case the "it" is Ned's "seed".
I hate that you've reminded me of this shit.

Supreme Court has ruled that having your finger pressed against a reader isn't
a 5th Amendment violation, whereas forced inputting of a password is a
violation of the 5th Amendment. If you want to use biometrics for security, use
it in conjunction with a secure passphrase

Instead of a “blankey” I used to always carry around and sleep with an old
ragged t-shirt my father used to wear so I called it my “daddy shirt”.

If you actually actually read the Bible, you'll find Satan in the modern
interpretation, as the fallen Angel Lucifer, isn't even in there.

In the Hebrew Bible you'll see hasatan mentioned. However this is just "the
adversary" a catch-all term for a number of antagonists in biblical stories.

In Islamic writings you'll see mention to Shaitan (or Iblis), who was a jinn
that refused to prostrate himself before Adam.

And in the Book of Revelations there's discussion of a war in heaven but a
fallen angel is not specifically mentioned, rather the antagonist is referred
to as the Dragon, and possesses his own army of angels.

There’s a particular pathology endemic to the professional managerial class
where they sincerely believe that they’re the ones keeping the machines
running. In reality, of course the workers are the ones keeping the machines
running. But to the PMC, the workers are the machines, and they hold that said
flesh-robots would simply grind to a screeching halt were it not for their
continued insistence that they get off their phones, maintain a strict dress
code and wear at least ten pieces of flair.

It’s an inherently dehumanizing worldview, and it infects every single aspect
of the way that they think.
