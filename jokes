During a demo for software that was in death-march mode, the customer asked one
of the guys on our dev team "If your software was running an airplane, would
you get on it?"

He said "Yes I would. No problems at all."

Customer was happy - demo went forward. After the demo we cornered the guy on
our team and said "Dude, you were lying your ass off!"

He replied "No way. If our software was running the airplane, it'd never get
off the ground."

A teenage boy is getting ready to take his girlfriend to the prom.

First he goes to rent a tux, but there's a long tux line at the shop and it
takes forever.

Next, he has to get some flowers, so he heads over to the florist and there's
a huge flower line there. He waits forever but eventually gets the flowers.

Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately, there's a large limo line at
the rental office, but he's patient and gets the job done.

Finally, the day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his
girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get
her some punch, so he heads over to the punch table and there's no punchline.
