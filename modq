This is my cake. There are many like it but this one is mine. My cake is
my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. 
Without me, my cake is useless. Without my cake I am useless. I must eat 
my cake true. I must eat faster than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. 
I must discover his name before he discovers mine. I will. Before God I 
swear this creed: my cake and myself are defenders of my country, we are 
the masters of my enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until 
there is no enemy, but justice. Amen.
